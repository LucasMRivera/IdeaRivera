          <p class="card-text">Nathan John Feuerstein was born in Gladwin, Michigan, on March 30, 1991. His parents divorced, and he was raised by his mother until his father had to take him away when her boyfriend abused him. His mother died from an overdose in 2009 which led to him dedicating the song "How Could You Leave Us" to her. He graduated from Gladwin High School in 2009, and was on the basketball team. NF started his career at the Fine Arts Festival organized by Connection Church in Canton, Michigan.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">At The Top</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Feuerstein signed to Capitol Christian Music Group in 2014, before the release of the EP, NF. This project was his breakthrough release on the Billboard, as it charted on the Christian Albums chart at No. 12, on the Top Gospel Albums at No. 4, and on the Top Rap Albums at No. 15. This extended play was reviewed by Jesus Freak Hideout and New Release Tuesday, receiving two three-and-a-half-star reviews. CCM Magazine reviewed the EP and awarded it four stars. His first studio album, Mansion, was released on March 31, 2015, by Capitol CMG.
 
          On May 30, 2019, he released the title track of the album, The Search. He would later release two more singles, When I Grow Up on June 27, and Time on July 12. The Search album was released on July 26.
          
          On February 18, 2021, NF released the single "Clouds", alongside a music video, and announced his mixtape of the same name, which was scheduled for a March 26, 2021, release. The mixtape included "Paid My Dues", as well as guest appearances from rappers Hopsin (Lost/LOST) and Tech N9ne (Trust/TRUST), followed by a third single, "Lost" featuring Hopsin, released on March 11, 2021. On March 26, 2021, Clouds (The Mixtape) was released.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Best Raper Alive</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Feuerstein has credited Eminem as his prime influence in hip hop, claiming that at one point that was all he listened to. NF's style has also been compared to Logic and Machine Gun Kelly. Although he found his musical upbringing in Christian hip-hop, Feuerstein has denied his label as a Christian rapper, saying "I'm a Christian, but I don't make Christian music. You're not going to reach everyone with just one point of view. I write about things I'm actually dealing with. You don't have to be Christian to relate to them."

          In 2013, Feuerstein appeared on Christian hip-hop artist Flame's album Royal Flush on the track "Start Over". In 2015, his features on TobyMac's This Is Not a Test track "Til the Day I Die" and Marty's Marty For President track "The One With My Friends" gained him fame and recognition in the Christian hip-hop genre. Feuerstein's 2017 collaboration with Futuristic, "Epiphany", enhanced his career in the secular rap industry.</p>
